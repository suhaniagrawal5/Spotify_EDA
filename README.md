# Spotify_EDA

🎧 Spotify Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis Project)

📌 Project Overview:
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Spotify dataset to understand patterns related to song popularity.
The analysis focuses on cleaning the data, visualizing key features, and extracting insights related to genres, artists, and albums.
The project demonstrates how raw music data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Python and data visualization techniques.

🎯 Objectives:
Clean and preprocess the Spotify dataset,
Perform EDA to understand trends and relationships,
Visualize popularity across genres, artists, and albums,
Improve understanding of how music characteristics relate to popularity

🔍 Project Workflow
✅ Data Cleaning,
Removed null and missing values,
Selected only relevant columns for analysis,
Ensured correct data types for numerical and categorical features

📊 Step 2: Data Analysis & Visualization:
Performed descriptive analysis on popularity scores
Explored distributions and relationships using visualizations
Compared trends across different attributes

🎵 Step 3: Insight Generation:
Analyzed how genres relate to song popularity,
Identified popular artists and albums,
Used graphs to clearly communicate insights

📈 Visualizations Used;
Bar charts for genre and artist popularity,
Distribution plots for song popularity,
Comparative graphs across albums

🎓 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
How to clean and prepare real-world music datasets,
Importance of EDA before any modeling,
How visualizations help uncover hidden patterns,
How to translate raw data into meaningful insights,

This project strengthened my foundation in data analysis and storytelling with data.
